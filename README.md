# lid-driven-cavity-2D

<p>Industrial CFD simulator for lid-driven cavity flow, implemented in Fortran with a modular architecture (params, grid, numerics, solver, I/O). Supports 2D uniform Cartesian meshes and second-order differential operators (gradient, divergence, Laplacian, curl) with advective schemes upwind/QUICK. Dirichlet/Neumann boundary conditions and adaptive CFL control ensure incompressibility and momentum conservation. The solver applies Chorinâ€™s fractional step projection method, solving the Poisson equation via an optimized Red-Black SOR, with adaptive residual computation and OpenMP parallelization, maximizing cache efficiency and avoiding race conditions. Hierarchical HDF5 I/O with DEFLATE compression, optimized chunking, and full metadata guarantees bit-exact reproducibility, comprehensive logging, and traceability of physical and numerical parameters. Automatic diagnostics for kinetic energy, enstrophy, vorticity, and divergence, validation against Ghia et al. (1982) benchmarks, and real-time NaN/Inf detection ensure numerical robustness. Extensible and configurable design for RK2/RK4 schemes, multigrid/Krylov solvers, MPI, and AMR, optimizing scalability, throughput, and computational robustness for research, advanced education, and industrial development.</p>
